- Sends notifications to a Telegram bot about a trend change and about a strong bullish/bearish trend.

## Why It's Useful – Benefits for Traders

This tool bridges two powerful data sources that rarely get combined in real time:

1. **Binance Order Flow**  
   Real institutional/retail pressure visible in live order book, aggressive trades (CVD, delta), imbalances → helps spot momentum before price moves.

2. **Polymarket Prediction Markets**  
   Crowd wisdom priced in Up/Down contracts → often leads spot price in short-term sentiment (especially on volatile coins like SOL or during news).

**By merging them you get:**
- Early detection of directional bias (order flow confirms / contradicts Polymarket odds)
- Higher-confidence entries on Polymarket binary bets (Up/Down in 5–60 min windows)
- Better spot/futures trading decisions (e.g. avoid fighting strong CVD against you)
- Reduced emotional trading — clear aggregated score + visual indicators
- Timely alerts → no need to stare at screen 24/7

**Who benefits most:**
- Polymarket traders looking for an edge on short-term markets
- Spot/day traders who want prediction-market sentiment as a filter
- Crypto enthusiasts experimenting with order-flow + prediction arbitrage
- Anyone building their own bots — this is a solid real-time data foundation

In short: more data → better-informed decisions → potentially higher win rate in fast-moving crypto markets.
